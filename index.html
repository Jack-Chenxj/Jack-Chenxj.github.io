    I am a materials science undergraduate at Xiamen University, on track to graduate in 2025. My academic focus is on the study of cathode materials for lithium batteries, particularly concerning their failure mechanisms. I investigate the redox behavior of oxygen under high voltage conditions, the migration reversibility of transition metals, and their relationship with material structure.

<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"><font face="Arial">
        I am also fascinated by the potential of these characterization methods to reveal phenomena that are not otherwise observable. The ability to directly visualize the structural changes that occur during the catalytic process or within battery materials during operation is essential for the advancement of energy technology. It's through these observations that we can correlate the microscopic structure of materials with their macroscopic properties, leading to the design of optimized materials for energy storage and conversion.

    My engagement with scientific research began in my first year at Xiamen University, where I joined Professor Peng's research group. <br/>Initially, I assisted in the development of cobalt-free, lithium-rich manganese-based cathode materials, gaining hands-on experience in synthesizing and characterizing these compounds critical for next-generation batteries.

 By my sophomore year, I was not only assisting with data analysis but also leading independent research efforts. I concentrated on refining the co-precipitation synthesis process, doping, and surface modifications to improve the electrochemical properties of these materials.

In my junior year, I delved into the charge and discharge mechanisms of lithium-rich materials, aiming to understand and mitigate the low initial Coulombic efficiency. My approach involved systematic experimentation with various charge and discharge regimes to uncover the underlying causes of efficiency losses, with the goal of enhancing battery performance and longevity.
