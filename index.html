    <!-- 这里要补充很多自我介绍-->
<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"><font face="Arial">    
    <br>
    I am a materials science undergraduate at Xiamen University, and will graduate in 2025. My academic focus is on the study of cathode materials for Li batteries, particularly concerning their failure mechanisms. I investigate the redox behavior of oxygen under high voltage conditions, the migration reversibility of transition metals, and their relationship with material structure.

        I am also fascinated by the potential of these characterization methods to reveal phenomena that are not otherwise observable. 
        By advanced characterization methods, we can directly visualize the structural changes that occur during the catalytic process or within battery materials during operation.
        It's through these observations that we can correlate the microscopic structure of materials with their macroscopic properties, leading to the design of optimized materials for energy storage and conversion.
        
        <br>
        I am interested in the design of battery systems that go beyond the traditional, 
        including new solid-state electrolytes, other high energy density materials such as disordered rock salt structural materials that utilize anion redox.

    Also, I am interested in Li metal electrodes, especially li deposition and SEI film formation.
These phenomena can only be observed and explained by state-of-the-art characterization, 
        so I am committed to learning various characterization tools (TEM/XAS) in depth to try to connect the phenomena to the theory.

    My fascination with scientific research commenced during my freshman year at university, when I eagerly signed up for a major scientific project and joined Professor Peng's research group. Since then, my focus has been dedicated to the preparation and modification of cobalt-free, Li-rich manganese-based cathode materials. 
<br>
    <b>Materials Preparation:</b>
    In the realm of Cobalt-Free, Li-Rich Manganese-Based Material Preparation and Modification, our endeavors have been centered on the synthesis and enhancement of these crucial cathode materials. Our work led to the production of high-performance electrode materials demonstrating remarkable capacity retention.
Our team succeeded in developing high-performance cathode materials, which maintained a capacity of 220mAh/g even after 200 cycles at a 1C rate.
<br>    
<b>Doping and Modification:</b>
    Through meticulous adjustments of the sintering temperature and Li mixing ratios, we explored the effects of lithiation behavior during the sintering process on anionic redox and structural stability. Our research confirmed that varying lithiation behaviors significantly impact the material's phase composition and distribution, including spinel, layered, and rock-salt phases, thereby influencing its electrochemical performance.
  <br>  
    <b>Charge and Discharge Mechanism Studies:</b>
    My engagement deepened as I embarked on Investigating the Charge and Discharge Mechanisms of Li-Rich Materials. This quest was not just about enhancing the material's electrochemical properties but understanding the intricacies of its low initial Coulombic efficiency. Through systematic experimentation with various charging and discharging conditions, my objective was to unveil the root causes of efficiency losses, paving the way for advancements in battery performance and durability.
